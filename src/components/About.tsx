      I've always liked that phrase, for obvious reasons. But it does seem a little out-dated. I mean, where? This is the internet. Where isn't really that important. (Though, FYI, I'm in Los Angeles.)

      I'm a full-stack web developer, and have worked in early stage startups to help people create complicated real estate loan applications online, and to share, view, and manage permissions on files.

      I enjoy the ease of reasoning about immutable data structures in pure functions with Elixir and Clojure, and am a proponent of writing stronger and more maintainable code with TypeScript.I worked in data management, accounting, and payroll for a few years after college, and transitioned to programming after taking classes at City College of San Francisco and building apps in my free time. Outside of the world of technology, I'm involved in the Young Democrats, serving (until moving down to LA) as the Communications Chair, and then Rules Chair, of the San Francisco Young Democrats.
